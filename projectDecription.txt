connectivity
never be alone when going to mini events or running errands
This application will be a platform where users host or attend mini local events,
    such as lunch, grocery shopping, reading in a library, house party partnering, 
    festival buddies. The goal for this platform is to increase connectivity in 
    the community, networking, social life and just making new friends in general.
